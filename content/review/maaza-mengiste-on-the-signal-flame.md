The language in this beautiful book is as textured and rich–as quiet and grand and unforgettable–as its setting: a small Pennsylvania town tucked in the mountains.

It isn't often that a story finds me making comparisons to literary greats from the first page. This is one of those books. In the end, what Krivák does is something all his own, and it is a triumph.
