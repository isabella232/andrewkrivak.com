What a balm to read a book so lovely that moves at a measured pace in this fast-paced age. That, too, is the point of _The Bear_, where life itself is lived with deep attention to the animals, landscape, and seasons by the very last humans on Earth, who by necessity and love share what they learn in remarkable fashion. This is a book that takes the reader to heart: a story to be savored, a grace to be received.
