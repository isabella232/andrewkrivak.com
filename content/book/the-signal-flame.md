reviews:
- attribution: Richard Russo
  copy_markdown: Readers will hear some echoes of Faulkner in *The Signal Flame,*&nbsp;and
    even more of Kent Haruf in the simplicity, honesty, and wisdom of its prose.&nbsp;
    But what they'll hear most is the deep, thoughtful, resonant voice of Andrew Kriv&aacute;k,
    a writer seemingly destined for great things. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  copy_markdown: Andrew Kriv&aacute;k gives us characters and a community that could
    have come out of The Deer Hunter—men and women challenged by natural and human-made
    disasters, love and simmering hate. While these small town Pennsylvania people
    confront life’s big questions, the true north of the novel is in the day-to-day,
    the ordinary, where Kriv&aacute;k has found the extraordinary. A well-crafted
    novel, elegantly told, *The Signal Flame* is a testament to Kriv&aacute;k’s singular
    talent.

  copy_markdown: 'The language in this beautiful book is as textured and rich–as quiet
    and grand and unforgettable–as its setting: a small Pennsylvania town tucked in
    the mountains. It isn''t often that a story finds me making comparisons to literary
    greats from the first page. This is one of those books. In the end, what Kriv&aacute;k
    does is something all his own, and it is a triumph.'
- attribution: Thomas Moore, author of *Care of the Soul*
  copy_markdown: With *The Signal Flame* Andrew Kriv&aacute;k shows us what masterful
    fiction can do. Inch by inch he reveals the hidden life of a multi-generational
    family, its impossible tensions and their miraculous resolutions. The beauty of
    the language invites you to go deep and become involved in the unfolding story,
    worried about the characters and relieved at their physical and emotional survival.
    Like a dream the story swallowed me up, and I came out of it more aware of the
    narrative power of my own life.

In their small town in northeastern Pennsylvania, Hannah and her son Bo mourn the loss of the family patriarch, Jozef Vinich. They were three generations under one roof, a war-haunted family in a war-torn century, but only one branch of a scraggy tree.

Having survived the trenches of World War I as an Austro-Hungarian conscript, Jozef journeyed to America and built a life for his children. His daughter Hannah married the European-born Bexhet Konar, who deserted the American army in World War II and, after his imprisonment, was killed in a hunting accident on the family land. Finally, in 1971, Hannah’s prodigal younger son, Sam, was reported missing in action in Vietnam.

Bo, Hannah’s remaining child, chooses a different path from his brother: Quiet, full of conviction, and with a firstborn’s sense of duty, Bo remains at home to grieve and to hope for reunion, to create new life, to embrace the land and work. From the narrative of this family’s experience, The Signal Flame emerges as a stirring novel about generations of men and women and the events that define them, old world values yielding to new world ways, and the convalescence of memory and hurt.

Beginning shortly after Easter in 1972 and ending on Christmas Eve, this ambitious novel gracefully evokes ordinary time, a period of living and working while waiting and watching and expecting. The Signal Flame is gorgeously written, honoring the cycles of earth and body, humming with blood and passion, and it confirms Andrew Krivák as a writer of extraordinary vision and power.
