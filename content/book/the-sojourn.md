description: |
  Inspired by Andrew Krivak’s personal family history, _The Sojourn_ is the story of Jozef Vinich, who was uprooted from a 19th-century mining town in Colorado by a shocking family tragedy to return with his father to an impoverished shepherd’s life in rural Austria-Hungary. When war comes, Jozef joins his cousin and brother-in-arms as a sharpshooter on the southern front, where he must survive a perilous trek across the frozen Italian Alps and capture by a victorious enemy.

  As poetic as _Cold Mountain_ and _The English Patient_, this novel grips readers with chilling scenes of death and survival as it evokes a time when Czechs, Slovaks, Austrians, Hungarians, and Germans fought on the same side while divided by language, ethnicity, and social class in the most brutal war to date. It is also a poignant tale of fathers and sons, addressing the great immigration to America and the desire to live the American dream amid the unfolding tragedy in Europe.

reviews:
- attribution: Sebastian Smee *The Boston Globe*
  copy_markdown: Surging in pace and momentum, The Sojourn is a deeply affecting narrative
    conjured by the rhythms of Krivak’s superb and sinuous prose. Intimate and keenly
    observed, it is a war story, love story, and coming of age novel all rolled into
    one. I thought of Lermontov and Stendhal, Joseph Roth and Cormac McCarthy as I
    read. But make no mistake. Krivak’s voice and sense of drama are entirely his
    own
- attribution: Leah Hager Cohen, author of _House Lights_
  copy_markdown: '_The Sojourn_ is a fiercely wrought novel, populated by characters
    who lead harsh, even brutal lives, which Krivak renders with impressive restraint,
    devoid of embellishment or sentimentality. And yet—almost despite such a stoic
    prose style—his sentences accrue and swell and ultimately break over a reader
    like water: they are that supple and bracing and shining.'

  copy_markdown: 'Charged with emotion and longing...this lean, resonant debut [is]
    an undeniably powerful accomplishment. '
- attribution: Mary Doria Russell, author of _A Thread of Grace_
  copy_markdown: _The Sojourn_ is a work of uncommon strength by a writer of rare
    and powerful elegance about a war, now lost to living memory, that echoes in headlines
    of international strife to this day.
- attribution: _Library Journal (starred review)_
  copy_markdown: Unsentimental yet elegant...with ease [_The Sojourn_] joins the ranks
    of other significant works of fiction portraying World War I -- Erich Maria Remarque's
    _All Quiet on the Western Front_ or Ernest Hemingway's _A Farewell to Arms_.
