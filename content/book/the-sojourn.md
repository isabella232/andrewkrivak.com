reviews:
- attribution: Sebastian Smee *The Boston Globe*
  copy_markdown: Surging in pace and momentum, The Sojourn is a deeply affecting narrative
    conjured by the rhythms of Krivak’s superb and sinuous prose. Intimate and keenly
    observed, it is a war story, love story, and coming of age novel all rolled into
    one. I thought of Lermontov and Stendhal, Joseph Roth and Cormac McCarthy as I
    read. But make no mistake. Krivak’s voice and sense of drama are entirely his
    own
- attribution: Leah Hager Cohen, author of _House Lights_
  copy_markdown: '_The Sojourn_ is a fiercely wrought novel, populated by characters
    who lead harsh, even brutal lives, which Krivak renders with impressive restraint,
    devoid of embellishment or sentimentality. And yet—almost despite such a stoic
    prose style—his sentences accrue and swell and ultimately break over a reader
    like water: they are that supple and bracing and shining.'
- attribution: _Publishers Weekly (starred review)_
  copy_markdown: 'Charged with emotion and longing...this lean, resonant debut [is]
    an undeniably powerful accomplishment. '
- attribution: Mary Doria Russell, author of _A Thread of Grace_
  copy_markdown: _The Sojourn_ is a work of uncommon strength by a writer of rare
    and powerful elegance about a war, now lost to living memory, that echoes in headlines
    of international strife to this day.
- attribution: _Library Journal (starred review)_
  copy_markdown: Unsentimental yet elegant...with ease [_The Sojourn_] joins the ranks
    of other significant works of fiction portraying World War I -- Erich Maria Remarque's
    _All Quiet on the Western Front_ or Ernest Hemingway's _A Farewell to Arms_.
