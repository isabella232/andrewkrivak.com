Readers will hear some echoes of Faulkner in *The Signal Flame,*&nbsp;and even more of Kent Haruf in the simplicity, honesty, and wisdom of its prose.&nbsp; But what they'll hear most is the deep, thoughtful, resonant voice of Andrew Kriv&aacute;k, a writer seemingly destined for great things. &nbsp; &nbsp;
