short_bio_for_books_page: '“Some writers are good at drawing a literary curtain over reality, and then there are writers who raise the veil and lead us to see for the first time.  Krivák belongs to the latter.  *The Sojourn*, about a war and a family and coming-of-age, does not present a single false moment of sentimental creation.  Rather, it looks deeply into its characters’ lives with wisdom and humanity, and, in doing so, helps us experience a distant past that feels as if it could be our own.”
